Create the PackageSize enum class with constants SMALL , MEDIUM , LARGE .
Enum should include two parameters in the constructor:
minimum package size in cm
maximum package size in cm
The PackageSize enum class should adopt the static getPackageSize method.
This method should accept package size and as a result it should return a
specific PackageSize object based on the package size passed
